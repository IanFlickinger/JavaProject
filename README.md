# JavaProject
Final Project for 1082.1 with Prof. Zak

**Goal**
This project is intended to be a game in which players round a twelve-space board. Each turn they will roll a die, move that amount of spots around the board, and perform an action associated with that square, be it a minigame, rolling again, picking a card, etc.

As of now, a start menu is brought up where the game is either begun, or exitted. Once the game is begun the amount of players may be chosen, and the names may be entered. There is a game with no GUI other than a console stream that allows players to roll and move, or quit on their turn. When the game is over, the winner is declared, and the players have the option of playing again.
