Monopoly Party is a Game for the Old, Young, Witty, and Wise.

When it's your turn, simply choose whether you want to move forwards or backwards.

Be careful with your decision though! Depeneding on which spot you land on you may have a poor time.


Everyone will begin the game with $5,000
For every square you move you will be paid one hour's wage. 
It is your job to successfully round up $100,000 before returning home safely to put it under your pillow where it belongs.

Good luck!
